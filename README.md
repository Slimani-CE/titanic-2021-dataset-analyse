# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
This is a notebook with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset and a machine learning model to predict passenger survival. The dataset is available at the [Kaggle Titanic competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tabular-playground-series-apr-2021).

## Requirements

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install them via `pip` or another package manager of your choice.

## Usage

You can run the notebook on your local machine or a cloud-based environment like Google Colaboratory. You need to download the `train.csv` and `test.csv` files from the Kaggle competition page and put them in the same directory as the notebook.

The notebook consists of two main parts:

1. Data analysis: explore the dataset, visualize the features, and engineer new features if needed.
2. Machine learning: split the dataset into train and validation sets, preprocess the data, train a classifier, and evaluate its performance.

The notebook includes markdown cells with explanations and code cells with Python code. You can execute the code cells sequentially or selectively and modify the parameters of the models and visualizations.

## Results

The machine learning model achieves an accuracy score of 0.81 on the Kaggle test set. The notebook shows the feature importance, the confusion matrix, and the precision-recall curve of the model.
